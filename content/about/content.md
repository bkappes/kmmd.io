<img align="right" style="width:400px;height:308px;" src="/images/materials-mfg-data.png"> Society has entered the silicon age, and in this age of information, the impact of data science is indisputable. From finance to agriculture, Wall Street to the Heartland, data science has an impact on every aspect of the economy. And the advance of once novel technologies to commercially viable products is no exception. Materials developments have improved thermal management in hypersonic aircraft and enabled grid-scale deployments of advanced photovoltaics. By connecting experimental measurements, models, and simulations to in-service performance, materials informatics reduces the time and cost of new developments. But to use materials informatics effectively requires a singular vantage point from the intersection of materials, manufacturing, and data science.

As the principal scientist at KMMD, Dr. Branden Kappes has spent more than two decades developing expertise at the intersection of materials, manufacturing, and data science. KMMD is uniquely positioned to develop the kernel function—the ϕ(x)—the simplify the relationship between materials and manufacturing and between both materials, manufacturing and data science, and enable the development of new materials technologies, new manufacturing technologies, and engage data science on the small and incomplete data sets typical in these fields.

Materials are enabling technologies that represent step-changes in human capability. They also represent the bottleneck and the gatekeeper to new applications. Understanding the intrinsic properties of materials—whether mechanical, chemical, or electrical—is critical to developing new applications, and through those new applications, new products. Combining experience across numerous materials production and analysis techniques, KMMD can extract information from disparate sources and correlating that data to inform the indirect process–property relationships that result in commercially viable materials: from steel alloys to lithium ion battery electrodes.

Because materials modeling and simulation have matured in step with the steady improvement in computing power, these models are now able to provide increasingly realistic insights from the atomic to component scale by virtualizing Edison’s make–test–refine–repeat approach to discovery. Importantly, the machine-generated output from these computational models and the ability to evaluate candidate materials and part designs hundreds-to-thousands of times faster than physical experiments result in regular, semi-structured data whose collection, curation, and analysis can be easily automated. KMMD has experience developing the custom computing infrastructures, parallel modeling algorithms, and machine learning/AI algorithms needed to create, simulate, analyze, and evaluate millions of novel materials systems, from new metal alloys to new energy storage materials.

Additive manufacturing is an archetype, a microcosm of the problems faced in the construction of numerous complex systems. With its ability to build parts with complex and organic shapes, additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, has introduced a never-before-seen freedom in manufacturing. But with this freedom comes a significant challenge: simultaneous control over both material creation and part production. It also introduces the ability to rapidly change the process variables that affect the structure, properties, and performance of component-scale parts. In his role as Operations Director of the Alliance for the Development of Additive Processing Technologies (ADAPT), Dr. Kappes directed the development of high efficiency, high throughput experimental characterization, featurization, and analysis techniques to optimize process, materials, and properties.

Whether in the development of a new material or the optimization of a new part design or new process, timely success depends on incorporating the domain knowledge acquired by experts over decades into the development of any reduced order model, whether that model be analytical, empirical, statistical, or AI. With broad experience, KMMD is uniquely able to connect domain experts and expertise across computer science, engineering, physics, chemistry, and materials science with the data collection, curation, analysis, and modeling capabilities of data science.
